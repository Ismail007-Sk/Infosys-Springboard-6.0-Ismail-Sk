This repository focuses on end-to-end podcast transcription and segmentation, covering the complete pipeline from raw audio to structured textual output. It includes in-depth work on audio preprocessing (noise reduction, normalization, silence removal, and feature extraction), audio modeling for speech recognition, and NLP techniques for text refinement, understanding, and post-processing.

Along with implementation, this repository is also intended as a learning and experimentation space, where we are actively working on and exploring these concepts to gain deeper practical knowledge. The project further investigates embedding-based methods to improve transcription quality, semantic segmentation, and topic-wise organization of podcast content.

By combining continuous learning with hands-on development in audio processing, speech modeling, and NLP workflows, this repository aims to build a practical, scalable, and industry-oriented foundation for a next-generation audio podcast transcription and topic segmentation project developed from scratch.
